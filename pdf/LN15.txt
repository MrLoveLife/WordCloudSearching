b"I S 460 Lecture Notes Professor Yong Tan Lecture 15 Project Management  Project and Project Management  A project is a [temporary] sequence of unique, complex, and connected activities having one goal or purpose and that must be completed by specific time, within budget, and according to specification.  Project management is the process of scoping, planning, staffing, organizing, directing, and controlling the development of an acceptable system at a minimum cost within a specified time frame.   Measures of Project Success \xe2\x80\x93 The resulting information system is acceptable to the customer. \xe2\x80\x93 The system was delivered \xe2\x80\x9con time.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 The system was delivered \xe2\x80\x9cwithin budget.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 The system development process had a minimal impact on ongoing business operations.

Each bar represents a named project task. The tasks are listed vertically in the left-hand column. The horizontal axis is a calendar timeline.   Joint Project Planning Strategy  Joint project planning (JPP) is a strategy wherein all stakeholders in a project (meaning system owners, users, analysts, designers, and builders) participate in a one-to-three day project management workshop, the result of which is consensus agreement on project scope, schedule, resources, and budget. (Of course, subsequent workshops or meetings may be required to adjust scope, budget, and schedule.)

Common synonyms include scope statement, project definition, project overview, and document of understanding.   Activity 2: Identify Tasks A work breakdown structure (WBS) is a hierarchical decomposition of the project into phases, activities, and tasks.   Milestones are events that signify the accomplishment or completion of major deliverables during a project.      2/4 \x0cI S 460 Lecture Notes Professor Yong Tan Activity 3: Estimate Task Durations 1.  Estimate the minimum amount of time it would take to perform the task. We'll call this the optimistic duration (OD).  2.  Estimate the maximum amount of time it would take to perform the task. We'll call this the pessimistic duration (PD).  3.  Estimate the expected duration (ED) that will be needed to perform the task.  4.  Calculate the most likely duration (D) as follows:    Activity 4: Specify Intertask Dependencies \xe2\x80\xa2 Finish-to-start (FS)\xe2\x80\x94The finish of one task triggers the start of another task.  \xe2\x80\xa2 Start-to-start (SS)\xe2\x80\x94The start of one task triggers the start of another task. \xe2\x80\xa2 Finish-to-finish (FF)\xe2\x80\x94Two tasks must finish at the same time. \xe2\x80\xa2 Start-to-finish (SF)\xe2\x80\x94The start of one task signifies the finish of another task.   Scheduling Strategies Forward scheduling establishes a project start date and then schedules forward from that date. Based on the planned duration of required tasks, their interdependencies, and the allocation of resources to complete those tasks, a projected project completion date is calculated.  Reverse scheduling establishes a project deadline and then schedules backward from that date. Essentially, tasks, their duration, interdependencies, and resources must be considered to ensure that the project can be completed by the deadline.   Activity 5: Assign Resources \xe2\x80\xa2 People\xe2\x80\x94inclusive of all the system owners, users, analysts, designers, builders, external agents, and clerical help that will be involved in the project in any way, shape, or form. \xe2\x80\xa2 Services\xe2\x80\x94a service such as a quality review that may be charged on a per use basis. \xe2\x80\xa2 Facilities and equipment\xe2\x80\x94including all rooms and technology that will be needed to complete the project. \xe2\x80\xa2 Supplies and materials\xe2\x80\x94everything from pencils, paper, notebooks, toner cartridges, etc. \xe2\x80\xa2 Money\xe2\x80\x94A translation of all of the above into the language of accounting\xe2\x80\x94budgeted dollars!   Resource leveling is a strategy used to correct resource over-allocations by some combination of delaying or splitting tasks.   There are two techniques for resource leveling: \xe2\x80\xa2 task delaying \xe2\x80\xa2 task splitting  Task Splitting and Delaying \xe2\x80\xa2 The critical path for a project is that sequence of dependent tasks that have the largest sum of most likely durations. The critical path determines the earliest possible completion date of the project. \xe2\x80\x93 Tasks that are on the critical path cannot be delayed without delaying the entire project schedule.  To achieve resource leveling, critical tasks can only be split.  3/4 \x0cI S 460 Lecture Notes Professor Yong Tan \xe2\x80\xa2 The slack time available for any noncritical task is the amount of delay that can be tolerated between the starting time and completion time of a task without causing a delay in the completion date of the entire project. \xe2\x80\x93 Tasks that have slack time can be delayed to achieve resource leveling  Activity 6: Direct the Team Effort \xe2\x80\xa2 Supervision resources \xe2\x80\x93 The DEADLINE \xe2\x80\x93 A Novel About Project Management  \xe2\x80\x93 The One Minute Manager \xe2\x80\x93 The Care and Feeding of Monkeys \xe2\x80\xa2 Stages of Team Maturity   Activity 7: Monitor and Control Progress \xe2\x80\xa2 Progress reporting  \xe2\x80\xa2 Change management \xe2\x80\xa2 Expectations management \xe2\x80\xa2 Schedule adjustments\xe2\x80\x94critical path analysis (CPA)  Activity Network \xe2\x80\xa2 Precedence relations among activities \xe2\x80\xa2 Two types of representations \xe2\x80\x93 Activity on arrow (AOA) \xe2\x80\x93 Event 2, Event 3, Activity(2,3)    \xe2\x80\x93 Activity on node  (AON) \xe2\x80\x93 Arrow to show precedence    Critical Path Analysis and Slack Time \xe2\x80\x93 Using intertask dependencies, determine every possible path through the project. \xe2\x80\x93 For each path, sum the durations of all tasks in the path. \xe2\x80\x93 The path with the longest total duration is the critical path. \xe2\x80\x93 Find slack times for non-critical tasks   4/4 \x0c"
