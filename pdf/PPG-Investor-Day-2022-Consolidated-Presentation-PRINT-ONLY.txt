You are advised, however, to consult any further disclosures we make on related subjects in our reports to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Also, note the following cautionary statements:Many factors could cause actual results to differ materially from the Company\xe2\x80\x99s forward-looking statements. Such factors includestatements related to the expected effects on our business of COVID-19, global economic conditions, geopolitical issues in Europe, increasing price and product competition by our competitors, fluctuations in cost and availability of raw materials, energy, labor and logistics, the ability to achieve sellingprice increases, the ability to recover margins, margin expansion, customer inventory levels, our ability to maintain favorable supplier relationships and arrangements, the timing of and the realization of anticipated cost savings from restructuring and other initiatives, the ability to identify additional costsavings opportunities, the timing and expected benefits of our acquisitions, difficulties in integrating acquired businesses and achieving expected sales and synergies therefrom, economic and political conditions in the markets we serve, the ability to penetrate existing, developing and emerging foreign and domesticmarkets, foreign exchange rates and fluctuations in such rates, fluctuations in tax rates, the impact of future legislation, the impact of environmental regulations, the ability to meet sustainability targets, unexpected business disruptions, the unpredictability of existing and possible future litigation, including asbestos litigation and governmental investigations. However, it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors. Consequently, while the list of factors presented here and under Item 1A of PPG\xe2\x80\x99s 2021 Form 10-K is considered representative, no such list should be considered to be a complete statement of all potential risks and uncertainties. Unlisted factors may present significant additional obstacles to the realization of forward-looking statements. Consequences of material differences in the results compared with those anticipated in the forward-looking statements could include, among other things, lower sales or earnings, business disruption, operational problems, financial loss, legal liability to third parties, other factors set forth in Item1A of PPG\xe2\x80\x99s 2021 Form 10-K and similar risks, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\xe2\x80\x99s consolidated financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.All of this information speaks only as of June 9, 2022, and any distribution of this presentation after that date is not intended and will not be construed as updating or confirming such information.
